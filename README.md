### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian Moretti.
I'm currently living close to Rome (Italy).
I'm currently learning how to become a good Front-End Dev.
I'm currently studiyng HTML | CSS | JavaScript as student in Start2Impact University.
I'm looking to collaborate with someone who wants to become a better Devs, cause I really need a lot of practise

About me:
I'm a Afro-Cuban Dancer and a lover of the Afro-Cuban Culture. 
This includes Caraibic Dance Style such as Salsa, Rumba, Afro, Timba, Bachata & Reggaeton!
I'm studying also Percussion with a Peruvian teacher specialized in Afro-Cuban Music.

When i'm not working or studying you can find me dancing, listening music, reading a good book or loosing my self on top of any mountain.
I really enjoy a lot spending my free time on the beach looking a stunning sunset
